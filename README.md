## Further Development

* I'd like to add more options for days/weeks/months for future output.
* Clean up the overall design and give it a more polished look.
* Maybe add a highlight or underline funcion for the description.
* Add a cross off function for the completed tasks.
* Make a recall function so that you can go to past data (this and future functions were in the works but we not completed).
